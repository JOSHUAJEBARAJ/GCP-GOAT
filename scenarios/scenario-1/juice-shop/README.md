OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

   clone [your own fork](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/fork)
   of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder with `cd juice-shop`
4. Run `npm install` (only has to be done before first start or when you change the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

   [latest release](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/releases/latest)
3. Unpack and `cd` into the unpacked folder
4. Run `npm start`
5. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

> Each packaged distribution includes some binaries for `sqlite3` and
> `libxmljs` bound to the OS and node.js version which `npm install` was
> executed on.

### Docker Container

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/bkimminich/juice-shop.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/bkimminich/juice-shop)

   of the repository)
3. Run `cd vagrant && vagrant up`
4. Browse to [192.168.56.110](http://192.168.56.110)

### Amazon EC2 Instance

1. In the _EC2_ sidenav select _Instances_ and click _Launch Instance_
2. In _Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)_ choose an _Amazon Linux AMI_ or _Amazon Linux 2 AMI_
3. In _Step 3: Configure Instance Details_ unfold _Advanced Details_ and copy the script below into _User Data_
4. In _Step 6: Configure Security Group_ add a _Rule_ that opens port 80 for HTTP

```
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y docker
service docker start
docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop
docker run -d -p 80:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
```

### Azure Container Instance

1. Open and login (via `az login`) to your
   [Azure CLI](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) **or** login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com),
   open the _CloudShell_
   and then choose _Bash_ (not PowerShell).
2. Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group name> --location <location name, e.g. "centralus">`
3. Create a new container by
   running `az container create --resource-group <group name> --name <container name> --image bkimminich/juice-shop --dns-name-label <dns name label> --ports 3000 --ip-address public`
4. Your container will be available at `http://<dns name label>.<location name>.azurecontainer.io:3000`

### Google Compute Engine Instance

1. Login to the Google Cloud Console and
   [open Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?cloudshell=true).
2. Launch a new GCE instance based on the juice-shop container. Take note of the `EXTERNAL_IP` provided in the output.

```
gcloud compute instances create-with-container owasp-juice-shop-app --container-image bkimminich/juice-shop
```

3. Create a firewall rule that allows inbound traffic to port 3000

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create juice-rule --allow tcp:3000
```

4. Your container is now running and available at
   `http://<EXTERNAL_IP>:3000/`

### Heroku

1. [Sign up to Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) and
   [log in to your account](https://id.heroku.com/login)
2. Click the button below and follow the instructions

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

If you have forked the Juice Shop repository on GitHub, the _Deploy to
Heroku_ button will deploy your forked version of the application.

### Gitpod 

1. Login to [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and use <https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/> to start a new workspace. If you want to spin up a forked repository, your URL needs to be adjusted accordingly.

2. After the Gitpod workspace is loaded, Gitpod tasks is still running to install `npm install`  and launch the website. Despite Gitpod showing your workspace state already as _Running_, you need to wait until the installation process is done, before the website becomes accessable. The _Open Preview Window (Internal Browser)_, will open automatically and refresh itself automatically when the server has started.

3. Your Juice Shop instance is now also available at `https://3000-<GITPOD_WORKSPACE_ID>.<GITPOD_HOSTING_ZONE>.gitpod.io`.

## Demo

Feel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!
