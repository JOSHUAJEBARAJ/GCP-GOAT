  "CATEGORY_VULNERABLE_COMPONENTS": "Vulnerable Components",
  "CATEGORY_XSS": "XSS",
  "CATEGORY_XXE": "XXE",
  "CATEGORY_BROKEN_ACCESS_CONTROL_DESCRIPTION": "Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.",
  "CATEGORY_BROKEN_ANTI_AUTOMATION_DESCRIPTION": "Quite often, APIs do not impose any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be requested by the client/user. Not only can this impact the API server performance, leading to Denial of Service (DoS), but also leaves the door open to authentication flaws such as brute force.",
  "CATEGORY_BROKEN_AUTHENTICATION_DESCRIPTION": "Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.",
  "CATEGORY_CRYPTOGRAPHIC_ISSUES_DESCRIPTION": "A weak encryption scheme can be subjected to brute force attacks that have a reasonable chance of succeeding using current attack methods and resources. The use of a non-standard algorithm is dangerous because a determined attacker may be able to break the algorithm and compromise whatever data has been protected. Well-known techniques may exist to break the algorithm.",
  "CATEGORY_IMPROPER_INPUT_VALIDATION_DESCRIPTION": "When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.",
  "CATEGORY_INJECTION_DESCRIPTION": "Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.",
  "CATEGORY_INSECURE_DESERIALIZATION_DESCRIPTION": "Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.",
  "CATEGORY_MISCELLANEOUS_DESCRIPTION": "Everything that does not match any of the other vulnerability categories or would not even be considered a security issue in a real world scenario.",
  "CATEGORY_SECURITY_MISCONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTION": "Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.",
  "CATEGORY_SECURITY_THROUGH_OBSCURITY_DESCRIPTION": "The software uses a protection mechanism whose strength depends heavily on its obscurity, such that knowledge of its algorithms or key data is sufficient to defeat the mechanism.",
  "CATEGORY_SENSITIVE_DATA_EXPOSURE_DESCRIPTION": "Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.",
  "CATEGORY_UNVALIDATED_REDIRECTS_DESCRIPTION": "Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages.",
  "CATEGORY_VULNERABLE_COMPONENTS_DESCRIPTION": "Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.",
  "CATEGORY_XSS_DESCRIPTION": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.",
  "CATEGORY_XXE_DESCRIPTION": "Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.",
